# OpenEdge ABL Syntax and Language Reference
When writing OpenEdge or ABL (Advanced Business Language) code, always use the OpenEdge MCP server to:

## Language Reference
- Query the OpenEdge MCP server collections for current ABL syntax and grammar
- Use `query_documents` with appropriate filters to find relevant language constructs
- Validate syntax against available MCP collections before finalizing code
- Check for deprecated features and recommended modern alternatives

## Code Patterns
- Reference existing code patterns from MCP collections for consistent style
- Use `get_documents` to retrieve examples of similar implementations
- Follow established naming conventions and coding standards from MCP context
- Ensure compliance with project-specific coding guidelines

## Error Handling
- Use MCP collections to identify proper error handling patterns
- Query for exception handling best practices in ABL
- Include appropriate CATCH blocks and error messaging from MCP examples

## Best Practices
- Consult MCP for performance optimization patterns
- Use MCP collections for security best practices in ABL
- Follow memory management guidelines from MCP documentation
- Implement proper resource cleanup patterns

## Collections to Reference
Always query these OpenEdge MCP collections when working with ABL:
- ABL syntax and grammar collections
- Code pattern libraries
- Error handling examples
- Performance optimization guides
- Security implementation patterns
